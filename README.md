# Disaster Tweets
A disaster happens and first reponders do not yet have eyes on the ground. But, people in the proximity start tweeting what they see. This information could be crucial for first reponders to properly prepare for their operation. Making use of this information is the task in [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started) a Kaggle challenge on NLP. Here, we built a classifier that identifies Tweets that talk about a disaster.
